Q5. Puzzle: 1000 bottles of wine
King has 1000 bottles of wine to be consumed in a party after 7 days. Palace guards found one of the bottles was poisoned by a spy. King wants rest 999 bottles in the party and for that the poisonous bottle has to be identified and discarded. King has given 10 prisoners whom you can test. You have to find a strategy to identify the poisonous bottles using these 10 prisoners. Below are a few key points to design a strategy. 
Bottles are of infinite capacity - you can take out any amount for testing
Even if you drink single drop of whole bottle you will d



If there are 256 combinations of 8 bits then by adding another bit at the front there are necessarily 512. That is all the 8bit combinations with a zero in front and all the same with a 1 in front.

Do the same again and clearly 10bit numbers have 1024 possible combinations. Which brings us nicely back to our problem, all the pieces are there we just need to state it explicitly

We will number the bottles 1 - 1000. We will number the 10 slaves, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 & 512. For each bottle of wine we will open it, convert it's number to binary and give a drop to the corresponding slave. 7 days  later when some of the slaves have died we will decode the binary sequence back to the bottle of wine
